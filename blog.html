For my font I used Google fonts to find the one that best suited the theme. I originally pick out a very plain and skinny text. However after showing family memebers and friends for critizism they all mentioned the font was "boring" and didnt quite fit into the scheme and became to distracting as it was standing out so much. So decdied to use Do Hyeon, sans- because i felt it suited the band and the theme alot nicer. After showing people thw website witht the new font applied I recieved postitive feedback.

For my button on shop.html I used bootstrap, they had a large choice of diffierent button I could used. I specifially chose this style because I though white stood out too much and a blue blended in with the backgrond of it. The filled in red button also was too distracting to look at and drew you away from the products. however the outlined red sat well the the background and also went along nicely with the red header and footer.

I also used font awesome to get my icons on the header and footer. I didnt orginally plan on using font awesome or the icons however the header looked plain and boring to look at. So I decided to use appropriate icons which I feel gives the user an idea of what is on each webpage before they go to it.

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://invidious.kavin.rocks/watch?v=KJadKSKA7Mg">this video</a> of Luke Smith's I have set up my personal website in an hour. Now it is finally time to delete my zuckbook account, thank God! So, here's my plan. Now that I got my own website, the next step is to set up my self host email and matrix server, so I can replace EVILmail and Line with those. I'm looking foward to it!</p>
<p>多虧Luke Smith的這支<a href="https://invidious.kavin.rocks/watch?v=KJadKSKA7Mg">影片</a>，我在一小時內就把我的個人網站寫好了，終於可以把fb刪掉了！感謝老天！接下來我打算self host email和matrix，用來取代萬惡的gmail和Line，期待那天的到來！</p>
